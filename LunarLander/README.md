Originally named MoonLander I renamed LunarLander.

### Project Moon Lander

In this class, students are encouraged to create their own projects. In our team of four, we decided that our projects are to help students accomplish the learning principles of object oriented programming in C++ with making 4 games in this class. The 3 games use the same simplified OpenGL libraries as the other projects.



Create a moon lander game using the principles of encapsulation.The object of the game is to safely navigate a lunar module to land on a flat portion of the moon's surface. To pilot the lander, horizontal thrusters can be activated to maneuver the ship left and right, and vertical thrusters can be fired to slow its descent.In the game, a random ground configuration is drawn, with a single safe landing platform. The lander begins at a random location along the top of the screen and begins falling according to gravity. The user can fire left, right, and bottom thrusters to guide the craft safely to the landing platform before the fuel is exhausted. The lander will crash if it touches the ground or approaches the platform with too much speed.
